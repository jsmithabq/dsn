DSN
---

A simple distributed sensor network for Yaak

The complete DSN distribution contains the source files,
DSN-dependent libraries/jar files, and other files.  In order
to build the source distribution, you must have already installed
ant (the Java-oriented project-management tool.)

The runtime distribution, produced by the ant target named "dist",
includes only the runtime components necessary to run the application.
The runtime distribution does NOT require ant.
